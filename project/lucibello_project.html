                The New York Mets are an American professional baseball team in Major League Baseball’s National League East division. The Mets were one of baseballs first expansion teams in 1962, bring national league baseball back to New York after the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants moved to Los Angeles and San Francisco respectively.

    <p><strong><u>How did the Mets become a franchise?</u></strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            After the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated to California, there was a strong interest from fans in having National League baseball back in New York. William Shea, who the team’s stadium from 1964-2008 is named after, was the primary force in bringing baseball back to New York.  
        </li>
        <li>
            With interest from former minority owners of the Giants, and other former owners of New York clubs, the National League and American League decided to expand with two new teams in each league, one of which would be in New York.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p><strong><u>Why are they called the Mets?</u></strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            When deciding on team names before the league expansions, the New York based team had 10 finalists for possible names. These names included the Avengers, Bees, Burros, Continentals, Jets, Mets, NYBS, Rebels, Skyliners, and Skyscrapers. 
        </li>
        <li>
            The Mets were ultimately decided upon in part because of a different historical baseball team, The New York Metropolitans, who played from 1883 to 1888.
        </li>
    </ul>
