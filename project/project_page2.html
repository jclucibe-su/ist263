            <p><strong>Regular Season:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    After joining  Major League Baseball in 1962, the New York Mets were often viewed as the laughingstock in the sport. In their inaugural 1962 season, the Mets infamously lost a record number of games with only 40 wins and 120 losses. Throughout the 60s, the team was plain terrible, and it would’ve been foolish to believe that would come anywhere near winning a championship within their first decade as an organization. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Surprisingly, in 1969, the impossible happened; the Mets were good. The team was full of young raw talent, with the likes of future Hall of Famers Tom Seaver and Nolan Ryan. Under new manager Gil Hodges, the Mets were able to finish with a remarkable 100-62 record in the 1969 season. Pitching carried the team to success with Seaver leading the way with a 2.21 ERA and 25-7 record. Other pitchers like Jerry Koosman, Tug McGraw, and Nolan Ryan also helped bolster the rotation and bullpen throughout the season.
                    
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <p><strong>National League Championship Series (NLCS):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Mets would end up having to go through the Atlanta Braves in the National League Championship season, led by baseball icon and Hall of Famer, Hank Aaron.  Shockingly, the offense led the way through the Braves with a three-game sweep leading the once laughed at Mets to the Fall Classic, the World Series.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <p><strong>World Series:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In the World Series, the Mets would go up against the heavily favorited Baltimore Orioles. The Orioles were a powerhouse Hall of Famer Frank Robinson leading the team to 109 regular season wins. The Mets would fall in game one of the series 4-1 and seemingly looked overmatched. Game two brought upon hope with Jerry Koosman dominating on the mound for a 2-1 Mets win. Game three featured a 5-0 shutout win for the Mets and game four with another win with Tom Seaver going the distance in a 10 inning 2-1 win. With the Mets leading the series 3-1 now, they would only have to win one more game to secure their first championship. Back at Shea Stadium, with Jerry Koosman on the mound, the Mets were able to come back after down 3-0 early to win it all. It was truly a miracle, and the 1969 Champion New York Mets would forever be known as the “Miracle Mets”.

            <p><strong>Regular Season</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The 1986 Mets are arguably the best team the franchise has ever put on the field. Led by Hall of Famer, Gary Carter and superstar players, Doc Gooden, Darrel Strawberry, Ron Darling, and Keith Hernandez, the 1986 Mets were an unstoppable force, both on and off the field. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On the field, this team was a winning machine, putting together a 108-54 record, best in franchise history, and dominating the competition winning the division by 21.5 games. Absolutely no team stood a chance during the regular season. Offensively, they were the best team in baseball leading the National League in runs scored and batting average. Defensively, the Mets were led by the young superstar pitcher Doc Gooden who was coming off his Rookie of the Year performance in 1984, and a Cy Young performance in 1985. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By the end of the season, the team had earned a reputation for not taking crap from anyone. The ’86 Mets frequently fought other teams and almost seemed excited to do so. They knew that they were better than everyone and didn’t care if you thought otherwise. The team earned the title of “The Bad Guys” and embraced that mentality throughout the year.
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Even with the incredible team that was on the field, the thing many remember about the 1986 Mets is their behavior off the field. The team drank in excess, abused drugs, and got into brawls. Players would often go back into the locker room, partake in drug related activities, and come back out to play like nothing had happened. At one point in the season, several players were even arrested for a brawl at a bar in Houston.

            <p><strong>National League Championship Series (NLCS)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Nonetheless, the team could win, and they proved that with one of the most memorable playoffs runs in history. In the National League Championship Series, the Mets were able to pull off a six-game victory against the Houston Astros with some extremely memorable games including a 16-inning thriller in game six.
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            <p><strong>World Series</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In the World Series, the Mets would face off against the Boston Red Sox who were trying to overcome the curse of the Bambino and their 68-year World Series Drought. After the first five games of the series, the Red Sox were up three games to two on the Mets. It seemed as if the curse would end for the Red Sox and Mets season long domination would also end.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Game six would become one of the most iconic games in baseball history. Going into the bottom of the 10th, Boston led 5-3 with victory upon the horizon. After the first two batters were retired, the Mets would go on to get two men on with Ray Knight at the plate. Knight would go on to single, one runner scored, and Mookie Wilson would come to the plate with two on and a score of 5-4. During Wilson’s at-bat he would six pitches before getting a pitch that would get past the catcher allowing another run to score. Now all tied up, a runner at second, Mookie Wilson still at the plate, history was ready to be made. Mookie would hit a slow dribbler along the first base line that would go through the legs of first basement, Bill Buckner, allowing the Mets to win the game. Written words do not do this moment justice. Vin Scully’s iconic call of this moment will go down as one of the greatest of all time. After winning game six in dramatic fashion, the Mets were able to close the door in game seven and become champions of the world for the second time in franchise history.
