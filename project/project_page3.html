    <h2><u>Tom Seaver:</u></h2>

    <p><u>Short Biography:</u> Tom Seaver, a.k.a “Tom Terrific” is the greatest Met to ever have the honor to put on the uniform. Born November 17, 1944, in Fresno, California, Tom would play college ball at the University of Southern California before getting drafted originally by the Dodgers in 1965. Seaver would begin his Mets career just two years later in 1967 at the age of 22. Seaver would go on to become one of the greatest pitchers in the history of baseball, winning 311 games, striking out 3,640 batters, and winning three Cy Young awards along the way. Seaver led the Mets to a World Series victory in 1969 and became a hero in Queens for decades to come.</p>
